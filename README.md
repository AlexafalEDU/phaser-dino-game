# phaser-dino-game
Using Phaser and Javascript to make a chrome Dino Game


## How to pull code
You should have a codespaces.new link provided to you by your trainer. Use that and press 'Create codespace' to start coding

Alternatively, if you would like to progress from this page, 
1. Click on 'Codespaces' in the left toolbar
2. Click on the green button labelleed 'New codespace' at the top-right corner of GitHub 
3. Select 'Tinkercademy/phaser-dino-game' as your repository
4. Ensure that Branch is 'main', Region is 'Southeast Asia' and Machine type is '2-core' (very highly recommended but not compulsory)

## Stopping and Deleting your Codespace
When you have a codespace, you will be using up your free quotas for your Codespaces core hours (usage hours) and GB-month (storage).   

To prevent the wastage of core hours, make sure to stop your codespace from running when not in use. (e.g. before going for a meal)
To prevent the wastage of core hours, delete your codespace when not in use (e.g. at the end of the day)

To stop your codespace from running:
1. Click on 'Codespaces' in your left toolbar
2. Click on the 3 dots on the right of your codespace
3. Click on 'Stop Codespace'  
Note: If you do not see a green 'Active' symbol and/or the 'Stop Codespace' button is missing, your codespace has stopped.

To delete your codespace:
1. Click on 'Codespaces' in your left toolbar
2. Click on the 3 dots on the right of your codespace
3. Click on 'Delete Codespace'

## Free plan
In your free plan, each user would have 120.00 usage hours and 15.00 GB-month per month.  
By using a 2-core Machine, each hour spent would use up 2 core hours, translating into 60 hours of usage per month.  
Do spend your hours and storage wisely!

## How to push into GitHub
Save the file first

In the Terminal, 
1. Stage the whole file using 'git add .' 
2. Stage a certain file using 'git add file-name' 
3. Key in your commit message using 'git commit -m "Type your message here"' (e.g. 'git commit -m "removed all bugs"')
4. Push to the remote repository using 'git push origin branch-name' (e.g. 'git push origin main')  
Note: "file-name" and "branch-name" are placeholders

## How to confirm if code has been pushed
Use either/both method/s  
In the Terminal,
1. 'git status' will check if your code is up to date with the version on GitHub
2. 'git log --oneline' will show your commit history
